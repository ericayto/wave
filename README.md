# ðŸŒŠ Wave

**Local LLM-Driven Crypto Trading Bot (Paper Trading)**

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me

Hi, Iâ€™m **Eric Aytekin**, a student in the UK.
I built Wave as a personal learning project to explore crypto trading, AI, and full-stack development.
Itâ€™s an experimental bot â€” no real money involved â€” coded with a mix of curiosity, late nights, and the help of Claude.

Wave runs entirely on your own computer, combining traditional trading strategies with AI-powered market analysis. Itâ€™s **paper-trading only**, so you can explore ideas without risking real funds.
